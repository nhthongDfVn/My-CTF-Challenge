What are words
1.
Anywhere you are, we am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see
How every single love I'll keep
'Cause what kind of guy would I be
If I was to leave when you need me most
What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them
What are words
If they're only for PIS
Then they don't
When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud those words
They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone
